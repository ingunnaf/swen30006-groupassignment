link for description generate uml diagrams from java code: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51786/how-to-generate-uml-diagrams-especially-sequence-diagrams-from-java-code/824221#824221 statistics tracking: 

Statistics tracking requirements: 
1) keep track of how many normal packages they deliver
2) keep track of how many fragile packages they deliver
3) total weight of packages delivered using normal mode
4) total weight of packages delivered using caution mode
5) total amount of time spent wrapping and unwrapping fragile items

notes on wrapping, delivering fragile items :
need to implement functionality to wrap and unwrap items
wrapping is 2 units of time
unwrapping is one unit of time
once a special, fragile item is being delivered on a floor, no other robots can enter the floor at that time

where do we implement this functionality? 
MailPool stores the robots, so perhaps this would be the place to ensure that robots delivering fragile items get the floor to themself

next meeting: Monday April 27th, 6pm Melbourne time
to do before next meeting:
- generate a uml diagram from the existing javacode (Crystal)
- do a domain class model (Ingunn & Cindy)
